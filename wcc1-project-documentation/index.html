                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>The audience is allowed to do what the characters in the painting do, to feel
                    what the characters in the painting feel, and to think what the characters in the
                    painting think.</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>"The River of Immortality" is a famous ancient poem that is used in the
                    beginning of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms". The poem is about a
                    conversation between two ancient people drinking wine while discussing the
                    deeds of heroic figures from a much older history. In this moment, the two
                    people in the poem become ancient in the eyes of the modern people
                    watching this work. What the audience does is no different from what the
                    people in the poem do.
                    </p>
                <p>The left half of the poem chants through historical phenomena that the
                    universe is eternal, the rivers never end, and the mountains are everlasting,
                    while generations of heroic figures are all fleeting.
                    In the right half of the poem, the poet uses the rise and fall of the past
                    dynasties as a laughing matter to help him enjoy the wine, showing his
                    contempt for the world and his indifferent and liberal feelings.
                    </p>

                    <p>The whole lyric has a generous and tragic tone, and when you read it, you
                        feel that it evokes a lot of emotions and a lot of feelings.
                        </p>

                        <p>At one point it was specifically pointed out that the poem is about two
                            characters viewing a beautiful scene and drinking wine and making a pair. So,
                            the purpose of this project is to try to create a deeper experience from the
                            narrative by visualizing the scene in the poem, allowing the reader or viewer
                            to see the same images as the characters in the poem, and, to do something
                            similar to the poem (discussing the ancient people).
                            
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Here is a translations of the poem.
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>On and on the Great River rolls, racing east.
                            Of proud and gallant heroes its white-tops leave no trace,
                            As right and wrong, pride and fall turn all at once unreal.
                            Yet ever the green hills stay
                            To blaze in the west-waning day.
                            Fishers and woodmen comb the river isles.
                            White-crowned, they’ve seen enough of spring and autumn tide
                            To make good company over the wine jar,
                            Where many a famed event
                            Provides their merriment.

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>

        
                
                <p>I have tried a lot to create the scene in the poem. I tried
                    to use wandering particles to create a "wave" effect, but
                    it didn't look like a wave, the particles were too scattered,
                    and simply increasing the number of particles made the
                    whole program very jerky, as shown below.
                    So I changed it to rainfall with thunder and lightning. As
                    a result, the scene in the content also changed from a
                    river to a lake. The meaning of the river in the poem is to
                    express the passage of time, and in a sense, turning the
                    river into raindrops can just as easily express the
                    process of having a going and no coming back, which can barely be justified.</p>
                   
                    <p>
                        In the code, I used a lot of looping structures
to maintain the continuous production of rain,
and a lot of random functions to randomize the
clouds, lightning, and rain movement. I experimented with many different color
modes and blending modes in order to add a sense of hierarchy to the
content.

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>In this project, there were many features that were not implemented at the
                    beginning, and I encountered difficulties in coding, so I had to keep modifying
                    the content and steering the work in a direction that was not the same as the
                    initial design.</p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, I have added some hints of narrative content to this image. In the
"Romance of the Three Kingdoms" in which the poem is set, the event that
started the whole chaotic world was the Yellow Turban Rebellion, a peasant
uprising with the slogan that the white sky is dead and the yellow sky will
dominate everything. In this motion picture, what is hidden behind the dark
clouds is the yellow sky.
If there is a chance, I hope to make the dynamic poster into a project with
more information and non-repetitive images in the subsequent versions.
